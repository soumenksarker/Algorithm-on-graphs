# Algorithm-on-graphs
In this course, i've learned how to decompose graphs i.e. Finding a exit from a maze, check consistency of Computer Science curriculum and find an order of courses that is consistent with prerequisite dependencies; 

Traverse graph in order, finding shortest path in it i.e. Compute the minimum number of flight segments to get from one city to another one, compute the minimum cost of a flight from one city to another one, detect anomalies in currency exchange rates and compute optimal way of exchanging the given currency into all other currencies;

In the last phase, I've implemented a minimum spanning tree which are used to plan road, telephone and computer networks and also find applications in clustering and approximate algorithms.
